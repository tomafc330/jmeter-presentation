Introduction
============

This example uses a Transaction controller to group all samples in a test case and roll-up the statistics into one result. This is useful when your test plan contains multiple test cases, and you want to see the response times per test case, since by default JMeter just records the individual requests.

Using the jp@gc - Response Times Over Time listener, you can then show only the transaction controller statistics.
